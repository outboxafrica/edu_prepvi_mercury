                            I was born, the 7th of 8 children of my parents;<em>Vicent and Valerie Mutumba.</em> Our home is located in Buddo, Wakiso district.<br> I fondly remember many happy moments and some testing ones.  Let me give you an  example:<br> I learnt  making crafts like mats etc from my mother who was so good at it and , I too had perfected the art. <br> Whenever I went away to play, my siblings would say to me that “your mat has been crying for you as you were gone”. <br> I would then feel bad and throw away that mat and start a fresh new one. In so doing, I ended up having no particular mat or craft to show!<br> There are many more fond memories of my early days which I can share but because of time, let me stop at that.

                <div id="right" style="float:right; width:45%; height:60%;">  <h4 style="color: darkblue;" >Education</h4>
                    <P style="color: darkmagenta;" font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; color: antiquewhite;>
                        I started Nursary school at a school called Milly and Martin Nursary school  in Buddo. I then joined Buddo Preparatory School where I found sharp pupils. In the school term that followed, my class teacher loudly  made a remark about my performance in class.<br> She said, “Busuulwa, will you be sweeping the road as...(and she mentioned a name of one of my classmates)..drive her car passed you? It so happened that the name of the classmate she mentioned was the same girl I secretly admired. <br> It was an insult to me,so I resolved to do my very best. I raised my standard that I always came among the top 10 students in class.<br> It therefore followed that at the final national primary exams, I got Distinction 2 grade  in each of the four exams sat.(The very best students would get a distinction 1 grade in each of the exam).
